## Minor Warnings (Not Critical)

1. **Icon format warnings**: App icons are .jpg instead of .png
   - Not critical for development or production
   - Can be fixed later if needed

2. **Dev dependency suggestions**: 
   - `@types/react-native` - types are included with react-native
   - `@expo/config-plugins` - used by your RTL plugin
   - These don't affect app functionality

## Next Steps

You can now continue with your development and builds:

### For Android:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### For iOS:
```bash

```
