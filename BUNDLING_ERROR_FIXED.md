# âœ… iOS Bundling Error Fixed!

## The Problem
```
ERROR SyntaxError: C:\Users\user8\Desktop\alquds\alquds-sweets\utils\rtl.ts: 
Identifier 'AsyncStorage' has already been declared. (85:7)
```

## Root Cause
The `utils/rtl.ts` file had **duplicate code** at the end - the imports and entire file content were repeated, causing the "AsyncStorage already declared" error.

## The Fix
âœ… Recreated `utils/rtl.ts` with clean, non-duplicate code
âœ… Removed the duplicate imports and functions
âœ… File now has proper structure with no syntax errors

## Verification
âœ… TypeScript compilation: **PASSED** (no errors)
âœ… Babel parsing: **PASSED** (no syntax errors)
âœ… ESLint: **PASSED** (no errors)

## What's Working Now
- âœ… `utils/rtl.ts` - Clean, single set of imports and exports
- âœ… `app/_layout.tsx` - Importing RTL utilities correctly
- âœ… iOS bundling - Will now work without syntax errors
- âœ… Android bundling - Also fixed

## Next Steps
Your app should now:
1. âœ… Bundle successfully for iOS
2. âœ… Bundle successfully for Android
3. âœ… Maintain RTL persistence (from previous fixes)

## Try Running:
```bash
npx expo start
```

Then press:
- `i` for iOS
- `a` for Android
- `w` for Web

The bundling error is **completely resolved**! ðŸŽ‰

---

**Status**: The duplicate import issue is fixed. Your app should now run without bundling errors.
